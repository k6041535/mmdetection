## Introduction

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.

<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.

## What's New

### ðŸ’Ž Stable version

**2.28.2** was released in 27/2/2023:

- Fixed some known documentation, configuration and linking error issues

Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/en/changelog.md) for details and release history.

For compatibility changes between different versions of MMDetection, please refer to [compatibility.md](docs/en/compatibility.md).

### ðŸŒŸ Preview of 3.x version

#### Highlight

We are excited to announce our latest work on real-time object recognition tasks, **RTMDet**, a family of fully convolutional single-stage detectors. RTMDet not only achieves the best parameter-accuracy trade-off on object detection from tiny to extra-large model sizes but also obtains new state-of-the-art performance on instance segmentation and rotated object detection tasks. Details can be found in the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07784). Pre-trained models are [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/3.x/configs/rtmdet).
